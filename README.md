# Bereans Bible Discussion App

![Logo](screenshots/bereans1.png)

Welcome to the Bereans Bible Discussion App, inspired by the diligent spirit of the Bereans in **Acts 17:10-11**:  
*"Now the Bereans were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true."*
